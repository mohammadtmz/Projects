## Project Overview
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience in deploying a scalable web application on AWS, covering the entire lifecycle from infrastructure provisioning to monitoring, scaling, and security.

The primary goals are:
- To familiarize with AWS services and cloud architecture.
- To implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform.
- To automate configuration management using Ansible.
- To set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- To containerize the application and deploy it using Kubernetes.
- To implement monitoring and centralized logging.
- To apply security best practices in a cloud environment.

## Project Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](link-to-architecture-diagram)

### Components:
- **VPC**: Provides a secure network environment.
- **EC2 Instances**: Hosts the web application.
- **RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Manages the database.
- **S3**: Stores static files.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Automatically scales EC2 instances based on demand.
- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Manages container orchestration.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitors system metrics and visualizes data.
- **ELK Stack**: Centralizes logging for analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
- **IaC Tool**: Terraform
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus & Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS)
- **Security**: AWS IAM, Security Groups, AWS Secrets Manager

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
1. **AWS Account Setup**
   - Sign up for an AWS account.
   - Set up IAM users and roles with appropriate permissions.

2. **GitHub Repository**
   - Create a GitHub repository for the project.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file.

3. **Tool Installation**
   - Install Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and other necessary tools on the local machine.

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Provisioning
1. **Terraform Scripts**
   - Define AWS resources (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, etc.) in Terraform scripts.
   - Organize resources into Terraform modules for reusability.

2. **Provision Infrastructure**
   - Use Terraform to provision the defined AWS infrastructure.
   - Verify that the resources are correctly deployed.

### Phase 3: Application Deployment
1. **Ansible Playbooks**
   - Write Ansible playbooks to configure EC2 instances (e.g., installing software, setting up the environment).

2. **Deploy Application**
   - Use Ansible to deploy the web application on the provisioned EC2 instances.

### Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline
1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment.
   - Integrate Terraform and Ansible into the CI/CD pipeline to automate infrastructure management and application deployment.

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Logging
1. **Prometheus & Grafana Setup**
   - Install Prometheus on an EC2 instance to monitor system metrics.
   - Use Grafana to create dashboards for visualizing monitoring data.

2. **ELK Stack Setup**
   - Deploy the ELK stack on AWS to centralize logging.
   - Configure the application to send logs to Logstash.
   - Use Kibana to analyze and visualize logs.

### Phase 6: Containerization and Orchestration
1. **Dockerize Application**
   - Create a Dockerfile for the web application.
   - Build and test Docker images locally.

2. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
   - Set up an EKS cluster on AWS.
   - Deploy Docker containers to the EKS cluster.
   - Implement auto-scaling and load balancing within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Phase 7: Security and Compliance
1. **IAM Roles and Policies**
   - Create IAM roles and policies to control access to AWS resources.
   - Apply least privilege principles in all IAM configurations.

2. **Security Groups**
   - Configure Security Groups for EC2 instances to manage inbound and outbound traffic.

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely manage sensitive information, such as database credentials.

### Phase 8: Documentation and Final Report
1. **Documentation**
   - Document each step of the project, including architecture diagrams, Terraform code, Ansible playbooks, GitHub Actions workflows, and more.
   - Ensure that all configurations, scripts, and processes are well-documented for future reference.

2. **Final Report**
   - Write a final report summarizing the project, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
   - Include key learnings and potential areas for improvement.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Managing dependencies between Terraform modules.
  - **Solution:** Use Terraformâ€™s `depends_on` feature and outputs to manage dependencies.

- **Challenge:** Configuring secure access to AWS resources.
  - **Solution:** Implement IAM roles with least privilege access and use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data.

- **Challenge:** Ensuring high availability and scalability.
  - **Solution:** Use Auto Scaling Groups and ELB to ensure the application can scale based on demand.

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with essential tools and technologies in cloud engineering, particularly within the AWS ecosystem. By following this comprehensive guide, the cloud engineer should have gained confidence in deploying scalable, secure, and monitored web applications in a cloud environment.
